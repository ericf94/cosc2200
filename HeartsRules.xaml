                    Hearts is a trick-taking game played with a standard deck of 52 playing cards.
                    The game is typically played with four players, although variations with different
                    numbers of players are also common.

				<TextBlock TextWrapping="Wrap">
                    The objective of the game is to have the lowest score at the end of the game.
                    Players earn points by collecting hearts and the Queen of Spades in tricks.

                    1. The player with the 2 of Clubs starts the first trick, and players must follow suit if possible.
                    2. The highest card of the leading suit wins the trick, unless a Heart or the Queen of Spades is played.
                    3. Hearts cannot be led until they have been "broken" by a player in a previous trick.
                    4. The Queen of Spades (commonly called the "Black Lady") carries 13 penalty points if taken in a trick.
                    5. At the end of each hand, players tally their points based on the cards they have collected.
